Description: In 1989, an downerclassman attending Miyoshi Academy mysteriously disappeared after the murder of ten girls, all of whom had some sort of relationship to the missing student. Years passed and no one could find him, and a story was passed that he killed them all, and later ran away from the public, in fear of being caught. Unbeknownst to them, this poor man was kidnapped by a young woman, who killed all those girls so she could have her “prince” all to herself. This is the story of Yasui Kei’s family. Ever since he was a young boy, his mother taught him that love is something that only comes to those who search and yearn for it. Years and years passed, and love never came to him, just as he believed it would. Just as he was about to give up on this fantasy of his, he finally found him. A boy that made his face burn red, made his stomach tingle, and brought a smile to his face every time he thought of him. This is what he had been waiting for his whole life…and there’s no way he’ll let anyone take him away.
